# Big Data Assignments

This repository contains my solutions to various assignments from the Big Data course. Each assignment includes one or more questions solved using Apache Spark.

## üîß Technologies Used

- [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)
  - Spark Core
  - Spark SQL
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Python

Some questions are solved using both **Spark Core** and **Spark SQL** to highlight the differences in complexity. Others use only one approach, based on the assignment instructions.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

Each folder corresponds to a set of related questions. Inside each folder, you'll find:

- One or more Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) containing the solution(s).  
- A subfolder containing one or more `.txt` files that include the question statements.

## üìö Table of Contents

| Folder | Link |
|--------|------|
| Book Ratings | [./Book Ratings](./Book%20Ratings) |
| Hamshahri News | [./Hamshahri News](./Hamshahri%20News) |
| LAX Passengers | [./LAX Passengers](./LAX%20Passengers) |
| Names & WordCounts | [./Names & WordCounts](./Names%20&%20WordCounts) |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Dataset Notice

The datasets used in these notebooks are **not included** in the repository (except for one case). As a result, the notebooks will **not run successfully** without the required data files. You may still review the code and logic.

Feel free to explore each folder to see how Spark Core and Spark SQL were applied to solve various types of questions.
